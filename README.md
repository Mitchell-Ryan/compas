# Lightbase backend framework

A lightbase backend framework

## Features

- Utility rich
- Boilerplate included
- Decently fast

## Why

Here at [lightbase](https://lightbase.nl) we had a constantly growing
boilerplate for new projects. To facilitate our needs more and to stop copying
and pasting things around this project was born. This project is for now
tailored at smaller projects and won't include things like http clustering (if
needed should be done at hosting level).

## Development

Development should be pretty straight forward. Run `yarn build --watch` and
`yarn test --watch` both in their own terminal. Before making a commit, make
sure to run `yarn lint`. Note that this automatically will try to fix most
issues that popup.

Collection of Lightbase backend utilities

## Why

Here at [lightbase](https://lightbase.nl) we had a constantly growing
boilerplate for new projects. To facilitate our needs more and to stop copying
and pasting things around this project was born. This project is for now
tailored at smaller & monolithic projects.

## Features

- Minimal API project boilerplate
- Script runner, can watch & reload almost anything (via nodemon)
- Flexible code generators supporting routers, validators, api clients, mocks
  and more in the future.
- Opinionated structured logging
- Common Koa middleware wrapped in a single function
- Various utilities like loading .env files, executing other processes and a
  basic template system
